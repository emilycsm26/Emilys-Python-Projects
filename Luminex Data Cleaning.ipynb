We now assume that we only have access to the data points and not the underlying generative function. These points could have been obtained during an experiment. By looking at the data, the points appear to approximately follow a sigmoid, so we may want to try to fit such a curve to the points. That's what curve fitting is about. SciPy's curve_fit() function allows us to fit a curve defined by an arbitrary Python function to the data:\n","'''\n","(a_, b_, c_, d_), _ = opt.curve_fit(f, x, y)\n","print(a_)\n","print(b_)\n","print(c_)\n","print(d_)"],"metadata":{"id":"Kp2UZJpMME3t","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1688070180624,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2154,"user":{"displayName":"Tonia Conner","userId":"03713651995907178528"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#7.
